Modyn is an open-source platform for model training on dynamic datasets, i.e., datasets where points get added or removed over time.

## ⚡️ Quickstart

For deploying and running integration tests, you will need [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
Furthermore, we use conda for local environments and tmuxp for easily managing components panes (optional).
For local development, run
```bash
conda env create -f ./environment.yml
pip install -e .
pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
```
and then `./compliance_check.sh` to check that your local installation of Modyn is functioning.

If you want to run all Modyn components, run
```bash
./run_modyn.sh
tmuxp load tmuxp.yaml
```

For running all integration tests, run
```bash
./run_integrationtests.sh
```

> **_macOS Installation:_**: If you develop/run on macOS, you need to modify the `environment.yml` file until we have conditional dependencies (#104). You need to remove the pytorch channel and all occurences of `pytorch::` from the file.

> **_GPU Installation:_**: If you want to use a GPU, you need to install `nvidia-docker` and adjust the `docker-compose.yml` file as explained in the file. Furthermore, you need to modify the `environment.yml` to use the CUDA version of Pytorch.

**Next Steps**.
Checkout our [Example Pipeline](docs/EXAMPLE.md) guide for an example on how to run a Modyn pipeline.
Checkout our [Technical Guidelines](docs/TECHNICAL.md) for some hints on developing Modyn.
Last, checkout our [vision paper on Modyn](https://anakli.inf.ethz.ch/papers/MLonDynamicData_EuroMLSys23.pdf) for an introduction to model training on dynamic datasets.

We are actively developing and designing Modyn, including more thorough documentation.
Please reach out via Github, Twitter, E-Mail, or any other channel of communication if you are interested in collaborating, have any questions, or have any problems running Modyn.

## What are dynamic datasets and what is Modyn used for?
ML is is often applied in use cases where training data evolves and/or grows over time, i.e., datasets are _dynamic_ instead
Training must incorporate data changes for high model quality, however this is often challenging and expensive due to large datasets and models.
With Modyn, we are actively developing an an open-source platform that manages dynamic datasets at scale and supports pluggable policies for when and what data to train on.
Furthermore, we ship a representative open-source benchmarking suite for ML training on dynamic datasets.

Modyn allows researchers to explore training and data selection policies, while alleviating the burdens of managing large dynamic datasets and orchestrating recurring training jobs.
However, we strive towards usage of Modyn in practical environments as well.
We welcome input from both research and practice.
