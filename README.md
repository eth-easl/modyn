Modyn is an open-source platform for model training on growing datasets, i.e., datasets where points get added over time.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quickstart

For deploying and running integration tests, you will need [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
Furthermore, we use [micromamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/micromamba-installation.html) for local environments and [tmuxp](https://github.com/tmux-python/tmuxp) for easily managing components panes (optional).
For local development, run

```bash
# In case you don't have micromamba yet
# macos:
brew install micromamba
# alternatively:
"${SHELL}" <(curl -L micro.mamba.pm/install.sh)

# Start here if you have micromamba already
./scripts/initial_setup.sh
micromamba env create -f ./environment.yml
micromamba activate modyn
pip install -e .
pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
```

and then `./scripts/python_compliance.sh` to check that your local installation of Modyn is functioning.

If you want to run all Modyn components, run

```bash
./scripts/run_modyn.sh
tmuxp load tmuxp.yaml # Assumes you have tmuxp, see above for link
```

For running all integration tests, run

```bash
./scripts/run_integrationtests.sh
```

> **_macOS Installation:_**: Make sure to run `./scripts/initial_setup.sh` as outlined above. If not, installation might fail due to PyTorch not being found. Unfortunately, the PyTorch channel currently does not support macOS.

> **_GPU Installation:_**: If you want to use a GPU, make sure to install `nvidia-docker` and confirm to use CUDA on first run of `./scripts/initial_setup.sh`. Optionally, if you want to use Apex (require, e.g., for DLRM model), make sure to confirm to install Apex. In this case, having the NVIDIA docker runtime as Docker default runtime is required. The script will try to enable this, if we have sudo privileges on the system. The CUDA version can be adjusted in the `scripts/initial_setup.sh` file.

## üîÅ What are dynamic datasets and what is Modyn used for?

ML is is often applied in use cases where training data grows over time, i.e., datasets are _growing_ instead of static.
Training must incorporate data changes for high model quality, however this is often challenging and expensive due to large datasets and models.
With Modyn, we are actively developing an open-source platform that manages growing datasets at scale and supports pluggable policies for when and what data to train on.
Furthermore, we are developing a representative open-source benchmarking suite for ML training on dynamic datasets.

The unit of execution in Modyn is a _pipeline_.
At minimum, a pipeline consists of (1) the model specification, (2) the training dataset and a corresponding byte parsing function that defines how to convert raw sample bytes to model input, (3) the triggering policy, (4) the data selection policy, (5) training hyperparameters such as the the learning rate and batch size, (6) training configuration such as data processing workers and number of GPUs, and (7) the model storage policy, i.e., a definition how the models are compressed and stored.
Checkout our [Example Pipeline](docs/EXAMPLE.md) guide for an example on how to run a Modyn pipeline.

Modyn allows researchers to explore triggering and data selection policies (see [Technical Guidelines](docs/TECHNICAL.md) on how to add new policies to Modyn), while alleviating the burdens of managing large growing datasets and orchestrating recurring training jobs.
However, we strive towards usage of Modyn in practical environments as well.
We welcome input from both research and practice.
