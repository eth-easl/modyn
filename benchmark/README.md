# Benchmark

In this directory, you find different scripts and examples that assist in running benchmarks on Modyn.
Currently, we provide an MNIST example and a Criteo 1TB Advertising dataset example 

## Benchmarks

### MNIST 
In the `mnist` directory, you find files to running experiments on a dynamic version of the MNIST data set.

### Criteo 1TB Dataset
We provide scripts and guidelines for using the Criteo 1TB benchmark data set.
The README in the subfolder contains information on how data is downloaded and preprocessed.
