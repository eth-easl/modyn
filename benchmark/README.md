# Benchmark

In this directory, you find different scripts and examples that assist in running benchmarks on Modyn.
Currently, we provide an MNIST example and a Criteo 1TB Advertising dataset example 


## Benchmarks

### MNIST 
The MNIST storage script downloads the MNIST dataset into a given directory. For more information on parameters run with `-h`.


### Criteo 1TB Dataset
We provide scripts and guidelines for using the Criteo 1TB benchmark data set.
The README in the subfolder contains information on how data is downloaded and preprocessed.
