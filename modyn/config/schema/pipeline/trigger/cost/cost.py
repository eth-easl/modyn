    We suspect the cumulated number of misclassifications is very unstable and badly conditioned on user input as
    it's a linear function with respect to the amount of data. As the training cost is also linear with respect to the
    amount of data, this likely lead to a very brittle trigger policy.
    That's why we penalize every second that an avoidable misclassification remains unaddressed (no trigger).

    It's a result of combining this data incorporation latency idea with the static number of misclassification
    performance trigger. This policy can be seen a combination of data incorporation latency based cost triggers
    and performance aware triggers.

    consider the cost of a trigger both in terms of wall clock time and
    number of triggers.
