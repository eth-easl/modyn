    Strategy introduced in:
    Active learning for convolutional neural networks: A coreset approach (Sener and Savarese)
    Implementation adapted from:
    DEEPCORE https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PatrickZH/DeepCore/main/deepcore/methods/kcentergreedy.py
    This strategy collects the Embeddings (leveraging the abstract class AbstractMatrixDownsamplingStrategy)
    and then selects the samples by clustering them in the embedding space. The clustering algorithm is k-center.
    This strategy was introduced first for active learning to discover which points are worth receiving a label.
    Hence, this class does not compute weights and returns a tensor of ones instead.
