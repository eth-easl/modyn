    This class represents an abstract evaluation strategy and its subclasses represent concrete evaluation strategies.
    An evaluation strategy determines on which slices of the evaluation dataset the model produced in a trigger is
    evaluated on.

    Given the timespan, i.e. the first and last timestamps of the samples in a trigger, an evaluation strategy returns
    an iterable of tuples via its `get_eval_intervals` method. Each tuple represents an evaluation interval to slice the
    evaluation dataset.
